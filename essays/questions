In the complex field of software engineering, you are bound to run into a situation where you will need to ask for help. However, with the seer amount of resources avalible online it can be diffcult to understand where and how you can ask your questions. While there are no such thing as dumb questions, there are definetely dumb ways to ask them. Especially when it is at the expense of another person. Thankfully, Eric Raymond's [*How To Ask Questions The Smart Way*](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) provides a comprehensive guide on when, where, and how to ask questions. 

### Why?

Ironically, at the beginning of Raymond's essay, there is a disclaimer to prevent to foolish readers from asking him and the other authors technical questions unrelated to his essay. This disclaimer presents a perfect example to the importance of this topic. Learning to ask questions the smart way not only ensures that you are more likely to receive the best possible assistance, it also prevents you needlessly bothering other people and their communities. Asking questions the smart way, in the right place, and for right reasons, will allow you to receive a better answer to your questions and it will add to the community by providing a meaningful resource for others.

### Open Bracket
Any organization nut will tell you that there is nothing more satisfying than checking a task off a to-do list. I get that same satisfaction from when I have completed my code and ESLint gives me that green checkmark. However, is this an unnecessary gimmick or do coding standards have actually value when programming? Coding standards are a set of rules designed to help programmers write their code efficiently and cleanly. ESLint in particular is designed to enforce coding standards for JavaScript programming and be easily added to most IDE. When implemented into IntelliJ, ESLint notifies users about formatting, syntax, efficiency, and other types of common errors. ESLint will even notify users about soft errors such as typos in strings. 

### Why so Nit-Picky
	Every warning that ESLint gives is a problematic part of your code that may lead to an error. The warning for things like missing semi-colons, opened-ended brackets, and other syntax errors will prevent your program from failing in tedious ways. This can be extremely beneficial when your program is long, and a single missing parenthesis could leave you searching for hours. However, the necessities of formatting standards can seem a little obscure. While it is true that a code does not have to look nice to run correctly, proper formatting can make a world of difference in a programmer's life. For example, JavaScript is known for being a first-class function language. This is a useful tool for programming. However, if you are coming from a language such as C++ or Java, programming with first-class functions can get quite confusing. When you are first learning a language and do not fully understand all the features, proper formatting can make your code easier to read and follow. Similarly, if you are working in a group, using coding standards for formatting ensures that every member of your team will have an organized project that everyone can understand with ease.
  
### Close Bracket
  Coding standards can seem extremely nit-picky. Especially if you are not used to coding in the style your standards are trying to enforce. When an extra space or missing indent gives you a red line, it can get very annoying very fast. However, over time, coding standards will reinforce a more efficient and clean style of coding, that will improve your overall programming abilities. Whenever you run into an issue with your code, proper standard formatting will let go over your code in a quick, organized manner. If you take every suggestion seriously, coding standards can be extremely beneficial to your project and help you improve your programming abilities.

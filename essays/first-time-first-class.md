### Javascript At A Glance

Javascript, like the other languages I have learned, is a high-level programming language and, so far, has been relatively easy to learn and use. The main difference with Javascript is that Javascript is the first language I have learned that uses first-class functions. First-class functions allow a programming language to treat a function just like any other variable. This means that functions can be passed as inputs or returned by other functions. Javascript, similarly to Python, does not require users to define datatypes. This means that functions can take and return multiple different data types depending on the situation. Just these two changes allow Javascript to be more intuitive and higher level than other programming languages. The use of first-class functions has been difficult for me. However, once I get used to it, it will greatly improve my usage of Javascript. Overall, I have been enjoying the Javascript programming language.

### New Language, Same Story

Compared to when I started my journey in the computer science field, I have grown very familiar with learning new languages. I have previously had to learn MATLAB, Java, C/C++, and Python. For the previous programming languages that I have studied, I had the privilege to learn them over time, in classroom settings, with the guidance of a professor and well design assignments. However, for Javascript, I learned the basics of the language over the course of a few hours through the online platform, [*freecodecamp.com*](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/). While this was a new method of learning for me, I found it to be preferable. Learning Javascript in this way has allowed me to skip/speed through a lot of the tedious and repetitive parts of learning a new programming language. Basics like if-statements and for-loops are not an exclusion to Javascript, and being able to quickly speed through those sections is helpful to my flow of learning. The main downside to learning a new language this way is that some parts do get "firehosed" in the process. An example of this is the ES6 formatting for Javascript. However, those things can be learned over time as you use the programming language.

### Javascript Olympian 

An effective way of practicing Javascript, and other programming languages, has been a timed athletic approach. Through the athletic software engineering method, I can focus on quickly solving a different programming problem. This allows me to develop my proficiency in a particular programming language, as well as perfect my thought process as a programmer. While initially, a time coding problem seemed to be stressful and a recipe for sloppy coding, it has actually forced me to improve my understanding and efficiency to succeed. When working in a group setting, the use of athletic software engineering adds a competitive nature, creating a fun and engaging experience perfecting improving programming skills.

### Summary

Overall, my experience with Javascript, and this new method of studying has been very efficient, engaging, and fun. I definitely plan to implement these practices when learning future programming languages.

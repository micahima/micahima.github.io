My first introduction to computer science was at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University as a first-year aerospace engineering major. As a freshman, I was required to take Introduction Computing for Engineers, also known as Introduction to MATLAB. As an aspiring Video Game Developer, I would love to tell you how excruciatingly boring learning MATLAB was. However, if I did not honestly enjoy the MATLAB course, I would likely not be in computer science today. With every project I completed, my passion for programming grew. The MATLAB course was one of the main reasons I was confident enough to drop out of my aerospace engineering program and transfer to computer science. 

As I continue into the second year of my computer science program, there are many aspects of the computer science field that I struggle with, such as algorithms and other theory-based topics. There are several computer sciences terms and jargon that still go over my head. However, my enjoyment of programming continues to persist, and I hope to improve upon the areas that I lack competence. A valuable area that I have most recently begun to improve upon is team working/networking. Many STEM-based students, such as myself, struggle with collaboration. However, I have found that working with my classmate has greatly improved my understanding of several topics. Collaboration in computer science has been an amazing tool for me to learn and share ideas, as well as further my understanding of several topics. 

Once I graduate, I hope to become a Video Game/Software Developer. Besides my computer science courses, I do not have any outside experience or projects. As I continue my program, I hope to develop the necessary skills to develop my own project and succeed in the industry.

summary: Web application development project for ICS 314 Software Engineering I.
---

This group project was the final assignment for my ICS 314 course which I complete with my teammates, Mei Luu, Thane Luna, Nathan Corpuz. The final project focused on utilizing all of the software engineering skills we learned to develop a web application. In addition to the technical skills required to make a web application, the project also emphasized project management, team management, and proper documentation. For this project, my group developed an application that allows students to share, track, and create profiles for stray cats around our college campus. Further information about the project can be found on the [Neko Map Project Homepage](https://neko-map.github.io/).

### Contributions

My initial contribution to the project involved the deployment of the [Neko Map Project Homepage](https://neko-map.github.io/) and mocking up the cat profile pages. After the planning stage of our web application was complete, I focused on the development of both the volunteer and cat profile registration forms. This included the development of the UI design and the integration of a MongoDB database to collect information from the forms. In the final stage of the project, I worked on the edit feature for the cat profiles, the last-minute inclusive of a public cat profile page, and the final corrections to the overall design and functionality of the web application.

### Conclusion

All the technical software engineering skills I learned this semester were used in this project. However, the non-technical skills were also essential to the success of the project. Especially during this time of social distancing, effective communication and project organization was something my group felt we needed to constantly maintain. While most of the technical skills for this project could have been practiced independently, the ability to successfully work with a team is an important aspect of software engineering. This final project did a great job of highlight both the technical and non-technical aspects of software engineering.
